#  Python and Scala/Java and C++, used together

This page has re-created to show some my works (blog-style).

Most (all) the code source  has moved to another Git Private directory for profesionnal reasons.
As high level coding involves a lot of work and high quality research work is quite demanding,
it's difficult to release all the code .

You can't imagine that Google releases all his search engine code....
But they sometimes release some utilities code to make a standard used by many people.




If you have interest in one of the project below and some code sources,
you can just send me a message  to noelkev0 gmail   , explaining your motivation.

I am usually very open, I will probably reply to you and give access to the code.


These are the projects I have worked or working one:

1. Using Java JVM inside Python in an transparent way: (this is not Jython)
  Example: Apacha Lucene, Tika, Common, many utilities to compile Java and use Maven

2. Auto documentation for Python: You have imported a new package  with import packagename
   There is no Doc !!!! ---> This module generates by parsing the python code, 
     the list of all functions, classes, methods (like Java Doc or Doxygen) in a text file.
   This is very useful if you have a new scientific package with no clue of the API

3. Feature Engineering with XGBoost in Scikit Learn and Graphlab

4.  Deep Learning tools for input pre-processing (NLP, text and images)

5.  Deep Learning model for Japanese language processing with Grammar models
    (Japanese is particularly difficult, little research is available using Deep Neural network)

6. Portfolio analysis using Precision Matrix  and Machine Learning Clustering.

7. Derivatives analytics in Python for Monte Carlo Simulation

8. Random generator using GPU (Cuda) Sobol and Mersenne Twister

10. Very fast machine learning using GPU (Scala based).

11. Apache Spark tools which can be used from GUI
